### Basic Personal Info
**Name**: Daphne Qin\
**Class**: APCS\
**Period**: 5

### About this Repository
- The original problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015 "Advent of Code 2015").
- I put my site-generated puzzle inputs in `input.txt`. If you'd like, you can edit that file to add your own inputs.
- The general syntax is `java ProblemX input.txt [1/2]`, with some exceptions:
  - Problems 10 and 20 use `java ProblemX [1/2]` since their inputs are coded into the program.

### Longest Runtimes Hall of ~~Shame~~ Fame
*Mainly so I can laugh at myself.*
1. **Problem 10 Part 2**: 72m 35.891s
2. **Problem 20 Part 2**: 18m 22.611s
3. **Problem 20 Part 1**: 15m 26.441s (15m 9.086s when slightly optimized)

### Future Plans
If I were to come back to this repo and edit some of the solutions, I would definitely:
- **Optimize 10 (especially Part 2) and 20 (both parts).** They seriously took forever to finish. Just look at their times in [Longest Runtimes](#Longest-Runtimes).
