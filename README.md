### About this Repository
- The original problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015 "Advent of Code 2015").
- I put my site-generated puzzle inputs in `input.txt`. If you'd like, you can edit that file to add your own inputs.
- The general syntax is `java ProblemX input.txt [1/2]`, with some exceptions (for example, Problem 2 is called `Wrapper.java` instead of `Problem2.java`).
